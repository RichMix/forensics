# Step-by-Step Guide Step 1: Identify the File Type (Q1)
file suspicious_file #the green file

#This should output the type of file, such as PNG, JPEG, or another common format.
# Examine File Headers with xxd:
xxd suspicious_file | head

# Common headers to look for:
# PNG: Starts with 89 50 4E 47 (PNG).
# JPEG: Starts with FF D8 FF.
# GIF: Starts with 47 49 46 (GIF89a or GIF87a).
# BMP: Starts with 42 4D.
# This step should answer Q1, giving you the file format.

# Step 2: Extract Embedded Files from the Binary Blob (Q2)


# Use binwalk for File Extraction:
# binwalk is a powerful tool that can scan for and extract multiple embedded files in binary blobs. Run:
bash
Copy code

binwalk -e suspicious_file
binwalk -e extracts files into a folder (likely named _suspicious_file.extracted). 
# Check the extracted files to see how many files were pulled out.
# Use foremost if Additional Carving is Needed:
foremost -i suspicious_file -o output_folder

# In the output_folder, you’ll see directories with extracted files, sorted by type.
# This step should answer Q2, giving you the number of extracted files.


# Step 3: Find the Hidden Flag (Q3) Search Extracted Files for Flags:
# After extraction, check each file for hidden text, flags, or other content using strings, which prints readable text:
strings extracted_file | grep -i "flag"

# Look for common flag formats (like FLAG{}, CTF{}, or other specific formats).


# Check Metadata: Some file formats like images and documents may hide flags in metadata. Use exiftool to inspect:
exiftool extracted_file

# Inspect Suspicious Files Manually: If no flag is found with strings or exiftool, open the extracted files (if they are images, documents, etc.) in their respective viewers or editors.
# By following these steps, you should be able to answer all three questions:

Q1: The file format of the green file.
Q2: The number of files extracted.
Q3: The hidden flag within the extracted files.

# Let's go through the forensic analysis step-by-step on the uploaded file (green_file). 
# I’ll run the commands and produce the necessary output as if working directly in a terminal environment. 


# Step 1: Identify the File Type (Answer Q1) Use the file Command:
file /mnt/data/green_file

# Examine the Hex Header with xxd: The first few bytes of the file will often give clues about its format, even if file isn’t conclusive.
xxd /mnt/data/green_file | head

# Step 2: Extract Embedded Files from the Binary Blob (Answer Q2) Use binwalk to Scan and Extract Embedded Files:
# binwalk scans the binary file for embedded data and attempts to extract any found files.
binwalk -e /mnt/data/green_file

# Count Extracted Files: Once binwalk completes, we’ll check the extracted files and count how many were found.
ls -l /mnt/data/_green_file.extracted

# Use foremost for Additional Carving (if Needed):
# If binwalk doesn’t extract all files, we’ll try foremost, which may find additional files by searching for file signatures within the binary blob.
foremost -i /mnt/data/green_file -o /mnt/data/foremost_output


# After running this, we can list the files in the foremost_output directory to count them.
ls -l /mnt/data/foremost_output

# Step 3: Locate the Hidden Flag (Answer Q3) Search Extracted Files for a Flag:
strings /mnt/data/_green_file.extracted/* | grep -i "flag"

# Check Metadata: If the extracted files include images or other formats with metadata, we’ll inspect that for the flag using exiftool.
exiftool /mnt/data/_green_file.extracted/*
