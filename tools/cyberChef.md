## The Recipe Area
This is considered as the heart of the tool. In this area, you can seamlessly select, arrange, and fine-tune operations to suit your needs. 
This is where you take control, defining each operation's arguments and options precisely and purposefully. The recipe area is a designated space to select and arrange specific operations and then define their respective arguments and options to customize their behaviour further. In the recipe area, you can drag the operations you want to use and specify arguments and options.

Features include the following:

Save recipe: This feature allows the user to save selected operations.
Load recipe: Allows the user to load previously saved recipes.
Clear Recipe: This feature will enable users to clear the chosen recipe during usage.
These can be found in the highlighted icons below:

This feature allows users to copy raw output directly to their clipboard, allowing them to quickly copy the results for use in other applications or documents.
Replace input with output: This feature allows users to quickly overwrite the input data based on the operations' results.
Maximise output pane: This feature brings the tool's interface to its default window sizes.

Let's discuss each step further.

Setting a clear objective is essential. This step involves defining specific and achievable goals. It helps answer the question, "What do I want to accomplish?". 
Objectives are vital in providing direction, purpose, and focus to your goals. 
One example would be, "During a security investigation, I found a gibberish string; I want to know what hidden message it contains if it has one."

Next, put your data into the input area. In this step, you use your data. This is where you paste or upload the gibberish string that you found.

The third step is to select the Operations you want to use. This can be tricky if you are not familiar yet with what you are dealing with. 
Following our example, we are still determining what to use to understand this gibberish string. 
During our research, we found relevant information that this gibberish string might be using anything related to encryption. 
Therefore, we decided to use any operations under the Encryption/Encoding category, including but not limited to ROT13, Base64, Base85, or ROT47. 
Note that we can use a lot of operations under this category. 

Lastly, check the output to see if it is the intended result. This begs the question, "Have we achieved our objective?". 
In our example, it would mean, were we able to decode the gibberish string we found? If yes, then that's it! If not, we may need to repeat the steps that we have taken.

# Extractors
The specific operations mentioned in the table below fall under the Extractors category.

Specific	Description
Extract IP addresses	Extracts all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
Extract URLs	Extracts Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) from the input. The protocol (HTTP, FTP, etc.) is required, otherwise there will be far too many false positives.
Extract email addresses	Extracts all email addresses from the input.
The Extract IP addresses will extract any valid IPv4/6 address from any given input. We recommend checking our existing room for a quick recap of networking: Networking Concepts

The Extract email addresses extracts any strings and characters with this format, anything@domain[.]com. 
Examples of domains include hotmail.com, google.com, tryhackme.com, and yahoo.com

Extract URLs extracts Uniform Resource Locator, commonly known as URL. , a URL is the address used to access resources on the internet. 
You can check the Web Applications Basics room if you would like to dig deeper into URLs and web applications.

Date and Time
The specific operations in the table below fall under the Date / Time category.

Specific	Description
From UNIX Timestamp	Converts a UNIX timestamp to a datetime string.
To UNIX Timestamp	Parses a datetime string in UTC and returns the corresponding UNIX timestamp.
A UNIX timestamp is a 32-bit value representing the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 UTC (the UNIX epoch). 
To convert "Fri Sep 6 20:30:22 +04 2024" into a UNIX Timestamp, use the operations To UNIX Timestamp, where the result would be 1725654622. 
If you wish to convert it back to a more readable format, you can use From UNIX Timestamp.

Data Format
The specific operations in the table below fall under the Data format category.

Operations	Description	Examples
From Base64	This operation decodes data from an ASCII Base64 string back into its raw format.	V2VsY29tZSB0byB0cnloYWNrbWUh becomes Welcome to tryhackme!
URL Decode	Converts URI/URL percent-encoded characters back to their raw values.	https%3A%2F%2Fgchq%2Egithub%2Eio%2FCyberChef%2F becomes https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/
From Base85	notation for encoding arbitrary byte data. It is usually more efficient than Base64. This operation decodes data from an ASCII string (with an alphabet of your choosing, presets included).	
BOu!rD]j7BEbo7 becomes hello world

From Base58	is a notation for encoding arbitrary byte data. It differs from Base64 by removing efficiently misread characters (i.e. l, I, 0, and O) to improve human readability.	
AXLU7qR becomesThm58

To Base62	is a notation for encoding arbitrary byte data using a restricted set of symbols that humans can conveniently use and process by computers. 
The high number base results in shorter strings than with the decimal or hexadecimal system	
Thm62 becomes6NiRkOY

Operations such as Base(64, 85, 58, 62) are known as base encodings. 
Base encoding takes binary data (strings of 0s and 1s) and transforms it into a text-based representation using a specific set of ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) characters.

Although we have a dedicated room for Hashing Basics, let's have a quick overview and discuss the most commonly used operation, Base64.

Our example would be to encode the letters "THM". We have a short ASCII Table here that we can use for reference. 
If you want to view the complete ASCII Table, please refer to this page here.

Decimal	Binary	Symbol	-	Decimal	Binary	Symbol
65	01000001	A		78	01001110	N
66	01000010	B		79	01001111	O
67	01000011	C		80	01010000	P
68	01000100	D		81	01010001	Q
69	01000101	E		82	01010010	R
70	01000110	F		83	01010011	S
71	01000111	G		84	01010100	T
72	01001000	H		85	01010101	U
73	01001001	I		86	01010110	V
74	01001010	J		87	01010111	W
75	01001011	K		88	01011000	X
76	01001100	L		89	01011001	Y
77	01001101	M		90	01011010	Z

Step 1: Convert To Binary and Merge(Manually)
Based on our table above, T = 01010100, H=01001000, M = 01001101. 

Next, concatenate these binaries and make sure they have 24 characters. You should have 010101000100100001001101

Step 2: Divide and Convert to Decimal(Manually)

Separate 010101000100100001001101 into 6 characters each. You should have 010101 000100 100001 001101. 
These are 6-bit characters; we should have four instances of this now. 
We need to convert each instance to Decimal. Let's convert, then!

Binary	Decimal (Base10)
010101	21
000100	4
100001	33
001101	13

Step 3: Convert to Base64 (Manually)
Now that we have the Numbers from the previous step, which are 21, 4, 33, and 13, let's look for the equivalent characters from our table below. 
This table represents a base64 index table.

Index	Character	-	Index	Character	-	Index	Character
0	A		26	a		52	0
1	B		27	b		53	1
2	C		28	c		54	2
3	D		29	d		55	3
4	E		30	e		56	4
5	F		31	f		57	5
6	G		32	g		58	6
7	H		33	h		59	7
8	I		34	i		60	8
9	J		35	j		61	9
10	K		36	k		62	+
11	L		37	l		63	/
12	M		38	m			
13	N		39	n			
14	O		40	o			
15	P		41	p			
16	Q		42	q			
17	R		43	r			
18	S		44	s			
19	T		45	t			
20	U		46	u			
21	V		47	v			
22	W		48	w			
23	X		49	x			
24	Y		50	y			
25	Z		51	z			
Upon checking from the table, we should have found its corresponding character by now. 

Index	Characters
21	V
4	E
33	h
13	N
Combine these characters, and you should have the equivalent of "THM" in base64 format. The answer would be VEhN.

Woah! Isn't that amazing? You just converted a set of characters into base64 manually.

Now, let’s discuss the URL Decode. This works by converting the percent-encoded characters back to their raw values. For a reference of these values, you can check the page here. Note that the default character set in HTML5 is UTF-8. Check the table below for a quick overview of what we can typically see in a URL.

Characters	From UTF-8
:	%3A
/	%2F
.	%2E
=	%3D
#	%23
