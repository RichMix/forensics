# Version Control Dump

Step 1: Set Up and Access the Backup File
Extract the Backup File (if compressed):

# If the backup file is a compressed archive (e.g., .zip, .tar, .gz), use the appropriate command to extract it:

# For a .zip file
unzip backup_file.zip

# For a .tar.gz file
tar -xzf backup_file.tar.gz

# Navigate to the Extracted Directory:

# Change to the directory where the backup file was extracted.
cd backup_directory

# Step 2: Locate Hidden Files and Directories & List All Files, Including Hidden Ones:
# Use the ls -la command to see all files in the directory, including hidden ones (files starting with a dot .).
ls -la

# This will display files like .config, .git, .env, or any other hidden files that might contain sensitive information.
# Check for README.md: If there’s a README.md file, open it to look for any clues or information.
cat README.md

#Step 3: Search for Sensitive Information in Files Search for Email, Flag, and Password:
# Use grep to look for specific keywords like "email," "flag," or "password" in all files, including hidden ones.
grep -ri "email" .
# Version Control Extraction
grep -ri "flag" .
grep -ri "password" .

# The -r option makes grep search recursively through all directories, and -i makes the search case-insensitive.
# Examine .git Directory (if present):

# Sometimes, sensitive information is hidden in Git repositories. If there’s a .git directory:
# List commits and examine the commit messages and content:
git log
git show <commit_id>  # Replace <commit_id> with specific commit hash if found

# Step 4: Check for Environment and Configuration Files
# Look for .env or Configuration Files:
# Environment files (.env) or configuration files (e.g., .config) may contain sensitive information like email, flags, or passwords.
# If an .env file is found, read it using:
cat .env

#Step 5: Capture and Document Flag and Other Credentials
# Document Information as You Find It: For each piece of information (email, flag, account provider, password), record it carefully.

# Example Commands in Sequence
# Extract backup if compressed
unzip backup_file.zip  # or tar -xzf backup_file.tar.gz

# Move into the backup directory
cd backup_directory

# List all files, including hidden
ls -la

# Check README.md for clues
cat README.md

# Search for email, flags, or passwords
grep -ri "email" .
grep -ri "flag" .
grep -ri "password" .

# If there's a .git folder, inspect the commits
git log
git show <commit_id>  # Replace <commit_id> with the actual commit ID if needed

# If an .env file is found, view its content
cat .env

# This approach will help you uncover any hidden or embedded information, such as email addresses, flags, and passwords in the compromised backup file.

# ChatGPT said: It looks like you've successfully extracted the contents of the git_backup.zip file and navigated through the .git directory. You have found several key files, including README.md and the .git folder with configuration and commit information. Here’s how you can proceed to locate the potentially sensitive information or flags within this Git repository.
# Steps to Proceed

# 1. Check the README.md File
# Since this file is present in the git_backup directory, 
# open it first to see if it contains any valuable information or clues:
cat README.md

# 2. Examine Git Commit History
# The .git folder may contain past commits, and these often include useful information, like previous versions of files or embedded credentials. Use the following commands:

# Show commit history
git log

# If there are commit hashes, check each commit for changes:
# For example:
git show <commit_hash>
# Replace <commit_hash> with any commit hash you see in the git log. This will display the contents and changes of files made in that specific commit, which may reveal information.

# 3. Inspect Git Logs and Other Files for Sensitive Information
# You can search for potential keywords directly in the .git files. These commands will allow you to examine logs and configurations more closely:

# Check recent HEAD changes
cat .git/logs/HEAD

# Check HEAD refs to see branch information
cat .git/logs/refs/heads/master

# View branch names in refs folder
ls .git/refs/heads

# 4. Use grep to Search for Flags or Passwords
# Since you’re in the git_backup directory, you can use grep to search for specific keywords (like flag, password, or email) in all files:

grep -ri "flag"
grep -ri "password"
grep -ri "email"

# This command will search through all files and folders in the current directory, including hidden files, for the specified keywords.

# 5. Look for Sensitive Content in .git/objects
# In Git, file snapshots and data are stored in the .git/objects folder. You can attempt to retrieve this information by looking at the objects with git cat-file:

# List all objects in the .git/objects directory
ls .git/objects/*/*

# Use git cat-file to examine specific objects if you know their hash
git cat-file -p <object_hash>

# Replace <object_hash> with the hash of any object file that appears interesting or relevant.

# By following these steps, you should be able to uncover any flags,
# credentials, or other sensitive information in the backup file. Let me know if you find any specific files or need further assistance with interpreting the results!

It looks like you've successfully retrieved the deleted flag from the commit history. In the commit f28a0c2e4ef9bdc2cd6e780abdbd8695485c7083, there was a file called FLAG.txt that contained the following line:

objectivec

SKY-LRHX-4910
Summary of Findings
Flag: SKY-LRHX-4910
Commit Message: "Oops wasn't supposed to commit that" (indicating it was mistakenly committed, then deleted).
Author: Greg Peterson (gpeterson@mpd.hacknet.cityinthe.cloud)
This flag (SKY-LRHX-4910) is likely what was inadvertently exposed in the backup.

You can now provide this flag as the compromised information for the task!

# Area where GPT guided to solve equasion

# You said: 
# The flag is great but that was not the password that we need



# ChatGPT said: To locate the password, we can further investigate the commit history and any deleted or modified files that might contain credentials. Here’s a step-by-step guide to continue the search:

# 1. Search for Passwords in Commit History
# Since we found the flag in a previous commit, the password may also be in an earlier commit. We’ll search for any files containing "password" or other related terms.

# List the git log to see all commit history
git log --all --oneline

#This command provides a summary of all commits in the repository. Look for any commits that might hint at passwords, configurations, or credentials.

# 2. Check Each Commit for Sensitive Information
# Use git show on other commits to see if any contain relevant content. Here’s an example if you find a new commit hash:
# Check the contents of another commit
git show <another_commit_hash>


# 3. Search All Files for Passwords or Credentials
# If the commit messages don’t provide clear information, try searching the entire repository for keywords related to passwords or credentials:
grep -ri "password" .
grep -ri "credentials" .

# 4. Look in Common Configuration Files
# Sometimes credentials are stored in configuration files or hidden files. Look specifically in files like .env, .git/config, or even README.md.
#This approach should help uncover any password or credentials that may have been stored in the repository. Let me know if you find any specific files or need further assistance!

# Output ->

# ChatGPT said:
# The commit labeled 20771a8 (next) Backup passwords looks highly relevant, as it suggests that it may contain password information. Let’s inspect it further to retrieve any stored passwords.

# Steps to Check the Commit for Passwords
# Show the Contents of the Password Commit

# Use git show on the 20771a8 commit to see if it reveals any password details:
git show 20771a8

# Review the Output: This should display the changes introduced in that commit. Look for any lines or files that may contain password-related information.
# If this commit contains the password, it will likely be displayed in the diff output. Let me know what you find, and I can help interpret the results!
